# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Crime Data Analysis

This project analyzes crime trends using the **Crime Data from 2020 to Present** dataset, sourced from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The objective is to uncover patterns in crime incidents, identify the most affected areas and age groups, and visualize key insights for better understanding.

## üìä Analysis Performed

### 1. Crime Trends Over Time
- Extracted Year-Month from crime dates
- Visualized monthly crime counts using a line chart

### 2. Most Dangerous Areas
- Grouped incidents by area
- Displayed top 10 areas with the most crimes via bar chart

### 3. Time of Day Analysis
- Categorized time of incidents (e.g., Midnight‚ÄìMorning, Morning‚ÄìNoon)
- Presented distribution using a pie chart

### 4. Average Victim Age by Crime Type
- Computed average victim age per crime type
- Bar chart visualizing top 10 crimes with highest average age

### 5. Victim Age Group Distribution
- Grouped victims by age (Under 18, 18‚Äì30, 31‚Äì50, Above 50)
- Bar chart showing distribution by age group
